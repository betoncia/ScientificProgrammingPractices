Hi, my name is Pablo Vali√±o Bouzas and this is my first contact with GitHub. Today is 07/10/22.
This morning i have been trying to clone my hard disk to an SSD.
This afternoon I am being able to start using GitHub collaboratively.
Hopefully this evening I will be able to clone my hard disk so I can run the systems required to the Master smoothly.

Hi, I'm Laura and this morning I've been working as a Life Science & Pharma project engineer in a company focused on sterilization processes.
In the afternoon, I have been reviewing my pending classes of the MBDS. 
Tonight I will relax at home watching an interesting movie or reading a book.
