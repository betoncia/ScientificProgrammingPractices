Hi, I'm Laura and this morning I've been working as a Life Science & Pharma project engineer in a company focused on sterilization processes.
In the afternoon, I have been reviewing my pending classes of the MBDS. 
Tonight I will relax at home watching an interesting movie or reading a book.  
Hi I'm bet and this morning after having breakfast I went for a run. After that I had coffee and lunch.
This afternoon I'm having a family meeting and at night I'll probably do some studying
