# collaboratorpvb_story in collaboratorpvb_branch
Hi, my name is Pablo Vali√±o Bouzas and this is my first contact with GitHub. Today is 07/10/22.
This morning i have been trying to clone my hard disk to an SSD.
This afternoon I am being able to start using GitHub collaboratively.
Hopefully this evening I will be able to clone my hard disk so I can run the systems required to the Master smoothly.
